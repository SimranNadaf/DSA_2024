time complexity : O(n) | Space complexity : O(1)

Approach 1: 
1. store last element in variable.
2. travel from last element to first, and set previous element to current element.
3. set index 0th element as stored last element.

Approach 2:
1. use two pointer, i=0, j=n-1(n=size of array)
2. swap(array[i], array[j]), increment i by 1. repeat this till i not equal to j.
