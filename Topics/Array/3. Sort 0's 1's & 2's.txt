** Sort 0's 1's and 2's

Approach 1: Sort Array using Sort(): TC: O( n log n ), SC: O(1)

Approach 2: Count 0's 1's and 2's: (Better) :  TC: O( n ), SC: O(1)
1. use count for 0 ,1 and 2.
2. arr[i] = 0 till counter of 0 is not zero(decrement after every assignment), then use counter of 1 and then counter of 2.

Approach 3: Dutch National Flag: Expected : TC: O( n ), SC: O(1)
1. low = 0, mid = 0, high = last element index.
2. repeat above steps mid <= high
	2.1. if mid th element is 0. then swap mid and low index element, low and mid increment by 1. 
	2.2. if mid th elemnt is 2. then swap mid and high index element, decrement high by 1.
