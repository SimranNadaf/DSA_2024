** Best time to buy and sell stock
Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(1)
1. buy = 0, sell=0, profit = 0.
2. loop from i =0 till size of array.
	1. if(a[i] < a[sell]) then profit += a[sell] - a[buy]. sell = buy = i.
	2. else sell = i.
3. if sell != buy then profit += a[sell] - a[buy].
4. return profit.
