** Count Inversion:
time complexity: O(n log n), Space Complexity: O(n) 
Approach: Merge Sort.
1. divide array into two half till one element left in array.(recursively).
2. merge divided array into original array, if second array element is less then count increment by 1. (recursively) for all divided arrays.
3. return count.
