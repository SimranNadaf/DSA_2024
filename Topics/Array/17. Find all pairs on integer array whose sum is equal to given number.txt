** Find all pairs on integer array whose sum is equal to given number
Time Complexity: O(n log n) Space Complexity: O(n)
1. initialize map of integer, integer
2. loop for all element of input array
	1. set as map[element]++.(increment by 1).
3. loop i = 0 till size of array.
	1. if a[i] == 0 and map[0] >= 2 then push {0,0} in ans vector delete 0 key from map.
	2. else if(0-a[i] found in map) then if(a[i]<0) push{a[i],0-a[i]} else push{0-a[i],a[i]} delete key 0-a[i] and a[i] from map.
4. sort ans based on first element of array.
5. return ans.
