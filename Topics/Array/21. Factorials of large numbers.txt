Factorials of large numbers
Time Complexity: O(n * m) n-number|m-lenght of answer, Space Complexity: O(1)
code: c++
Approach:
1. initialize an ans array of size 1 with 1 as first element.
2. loop from i = 2 till n
	1. carry = 0
	2. loop from j = 0 to j less than size of ans array.
		1. temp = ans[j] * i + carry
		2. ans[i] = temp % 10.
		3. carry = temp / 10.
	3. loop till carry is not zero 0.
		1. push carry%10 into ans array
		2. carry = carry / 10.
3. reverse ans array
4. return ans array
