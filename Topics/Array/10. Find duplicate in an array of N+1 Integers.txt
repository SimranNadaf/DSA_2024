** Find duplicate in an array of N+1 Integers
Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(n)
Approach: using hash table(map)
1. map of int, int and ans as array
2. for loop from i = 0 to last index
	1. map[a[i]]++
3. loop for map
	1. if map.value is greater than 1, then push key into ans array.
4. return ans.
